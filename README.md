# Brainprint Recognition Based on the Stable SSVEP Space-Frequency Energy Distribution
This repository provides a sample implementation demonstrating **identity recognition** based on the stable spatial-frequency energy distribution of Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP).

## Data
The dataset used in this example is from the paper "A Benchmark Dataset for SSVEP-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces". The dataset is available for download from the Tsinghua University BCI Lab website at: http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.

## Key Features
-Implements brainprint recognition using SSVEP signatures
-Analyzes stable space-frequency energy distribution patterns
-Serves as a proof-of-concept for biometric identification
