# Brainprint Recognition via Stable SSVEP Space-Frequency Energy Distribution

This repository provides a sample implementation demonstrating **identity recognition** based on the stable spatial-frequency energy distribution of Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP).

## Key Features
-Implements brainprint recognition using SSVEP signatures
-Analyzes stable space-frequency energy distribution patterns
-Serves as a proof-of-concept for biometric identification
